### Hi there, I'm Mateiyendou Kombat! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Aspiring Back-End Developer pursuing dual Bachelor's degrees: a BSc in Computer Science from the University of the People and a BSc in Statistics from KNUST. This unique combination of computational theory and quantitative analysis provides the foundation for my work in Python and R. I am now diving deep into Java, Git, and Bash to build robust, data-driven back-end systems. I thrive on solving complex, data-centric problems and continuously learning new technologies.
